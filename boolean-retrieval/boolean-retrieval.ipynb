      "we're doing our best to try to have the most innovative partnership \n",
      "between the Labor Department and the Education Department and the \n",
      "private sector to build a good school-to-work transition.  And we're \n",

      "can prepare students for this world of work.\n",
      "\t     This week, the Education Department and the Labor \n",
      "Department are hosting a conference here in Washington, D.C. called \n",
      "Summer Challenge, a program of work and learning, to America's youth.  \n",
      "The aim is to use some special funds from President Clinton's \n",
      "proposed economic stimulus package to provide educationally-enriched \n",
      "jobs and summer school programs for young people in disadvantaged \n",
      "areas of the country.  \n",
      "\t     Mr. President, let's talk a minute -- you alluded to it \n",
      "somewhat -- about the  Summer Youth Challenge.  Your program calls \n",
      "for more educational enrichment in the summer jobs.  And why in your \n",
      "words is that so important?\n",
      "\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I think it's important for two reasons.  \n",
      "First of all, a lot of the young people we're trying to reach may \n",
      "have had trouble adjusting to school and learning.  And while we want \n",
      "them to have a good experience with a real job, we also want them to \n",
      "continue to learn during the summer because we know from a lot of \n",
      "research that a lot of kids that have trouble learning in school may \n",
      "forget as much as 30 percent of what they learned the previous year \n",
      "over the summertime.  And that is a very unproductive thing for \n",
      "schools to have to take up a lot of time teaching what they already \n",
      "taught before.\n",
      "\t     Secondly, we want to help these young people progress, \n",
      "not only in terms of work, but in terms of learning.  We want to \n",
      "abolish the artificial dividing line between what is work and what is \n",
      "learning because we think that the best and most productive workers \n",
      "will have to be lifetime learners.  And we think that this experience \n",
      "could maybe drive that point home and prepare these young people to \n",
      "succeed in school, or at work, or in college as they go on.\n",
      "\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, I think the fact that these are \n",
      "disadvantaged kids -- that gap, that lag you mentioned as they go \n",
      "into the next year, is really even greater.  \n",
      "\t     Secretary Reich, of course, you have training programs \n",
      "throughout the year.  And I wonder is you have any comment about this \n",
      "educational component of training.\n",
      "\t     SECRETARY REICH:  Well, what we've learned, Mr. \n",
      "Secretary, is that for many young people, whether it's for the summer \n",
      "or for the year, actually on-the-job work experience combined with \n",
      "education is one of the best ways of learning.  Many young people, \n",
      "for example, have a lot -- they have a difficult time learning \n",
      "geometry.  But when they actually are there building something or \n",
      "working on something, and they can see the exact and direct \n",
      "application of geometry, they understand what it's used for.  And a \n",
      "lot of young people -- just that sense of connection between \n",
      "education and the world of work is terribly, terribly important.  \n",
      "It's important during the summer, but it's important for a lot of \n",
      "young people even beyond the summer.\n",
      "\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you.  \n",
      "\t     Mr. President, you've called for a youth apprenticeship \n",
      "program, school-to-work transition.  And I wonder if you would tell \n",
      "us a little bit about your concept of that and how you see it \n",
      "developing.\n",
      "\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, first of all, let's talk about why \n",
      "it's important.  Most new jobs that will be created in this decade \n",
      "will not require a four-year college degree, but most of them will \n",
      "require some learning and skills that go well beyond what most people \n",
      "get in a high school diploma.  \n",
      "\t     If you look at the last 10 years, the average salaries \n",
      "of young people that had at least two years of good post-high school \n",
      "education was a good salary that went up over the decade.  The young \n",
      "people who had less than that tended to have lower wages that did not \n",
      "go up, and in many cases in real terms fell over the decade, because \n",
      "they weren't productive, they weren't more valuable to their \n",
      "employers.\n",
      "\t     So we think America has a big economic interest in \n",
      "trying to ensure that all the young people who get out of high school \n",
      "but don't go on to college make a transition to work, which includes \n",
      "two years of further training either in a community college, a \n",
      "vocational setting, or perhaps on the job.  And what I have done in \n",
      "this budget, as you know, is to give you and Secretary Reich some \n",
      "funds and some incentives to try to work in partnership with states \n",
      "and with the private sector to build these programs state-by-state in \n",
      "a way that would be customized essentially by the business community, \n",
      "based on the needs of the economy in any given area.  It could \n",
      "revolutionize long-term the quality of the American work force and \n",
      "the earnings of American workers.\n",
      "\t     SECRETARY REICH:  I should add, Mr. President -- I think \n",
      "you know this from your experience in Arkansas -- and many of the \n",
      "people watching this program -- that the business community and \n",
      "educators, labor groups are already in many of our communities, many \n",
      "of our states, building a school-to-work transition program.  In \n",
      "fact, there's an awful lot of ferment, a lot of excitement.  The \n",
      "people watching this program probably are the ones who are most \n",
      "directly involved in that.  And more power to them.  Secretary Riley \n",
      "and I are going to do everything we can to build on the successes \n",
      "already out there.\n",
      "\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Bob, we're going to be talking tonight \n",
      "about youth apprenticeship and tech prep, the co-op learning  \n",
      "career academies.  And what features all those programs that deal \n",
      "with this subject -- what are some of the features that every one of \n",
      "these school-to-work programs might have that   are important?\n",
      "\t     SECRETARY REICH:  Well, one thing that we've seen -- and \n",
      "you and I have been working at this for a long time, and you much \n",
      "longer than I -- we've seen that active involvement of the business \n",
      "community is absolutely essential.  And I'm so delighted that we're \n",
      "doing this in the headquarters of the Chamber of Commerce.  The \n",
      "Chamber of Commerce of the United States is committed to doing these \n",
      "kinds of programs -- training, education, retraining -- and we've \n",
      "aimed to work very closely with the Chamber.\n",
      "\t     The business community is going to be actively engaged \n",
      "in developing almost an audit of the kind of jobs that are needed and \n",
      "helping the educators, community colleges, technical institutions \n",
      "develop curricula that are relevant for the jobs of the future.\n",
      "\t     Communities have got to come together.  I mean, this is \n",
      "one of the most important things.  You've got to have all of these \n",
      "players in a community come together and work together and cooperate \n",
      "together.  You know, too often we have the educators over here and \n",
      "the business leaders over here, labor groups over here and everybody \n",
      "is talking, but they're not really working together in a common \n",
      "strategy.\n",
      "\t     And the third and final ingredient I would say, Dick, \n",
      "would be a commitment to excellence -- a commitment both to academic \n",
      "excellence and also to skills development excellence.  This is not a \n",
      "tracking program we're talking about for kids who are not going to \n",
      "make it.  This is a program that every young person ought to be \n",
      "eligible for.  If they want to go on beyond that to four-year \n",
      "college, that's fine.  That ought to be permissible.  But we're \n",
      "talking about the foundation of learning about jobs, the foundation \n",
      "skills for on-the-job learning.\n",
      "\t     And again, those are the critical components.  It's \n",
      "already being done.\n",
      "\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I think -- if I might just interject one \n",
      "point based on my personal experience at home -- the business \n",
      "community has a critical role to play, not simply in saying here are \n",
      "the job skills that are needed and here's what ought to be taught, \n",
      "but also in monitoring that excellence.  If you have the right sort \n",
      "of partnership there, the people who are paying the taxes and who are \n",
      "going to then be hiring the workers are not going to permit the \n",
      "second-rate programs to survive if they have any way to shape and \n",
      "influence them.  So I think that's very important.\n",
      "\t     And when we try to, if you will, fill in the blanks at \n",
      "the federal level, trying to set some standards and provide some \n",
      "funds, one of the things that we want to be sure and do is to make \n",
      "sure that the employer has a heavy amount of influence over the \n",
      "quality of these programs, because that's really what's going to \n",
      "determine whether the whole thing is worthwhile.\n",
      "\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  That's great.  We've been talking, of \n",
      "course, about school-to-work and also the jobs and economic recovery \n",
      "program for this summer and fall.  But let's talk just a moment about \n",
      "long-term school reform.  It's something especially close to me.  Mr. \n",
      "President, I wonder if you would give us some of your ideas for the \n",
      "communities out here on Goals 2000 legislation that I think will be \n",
      "coming forth before too long.\n",
      "\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, as you know, back when you and I \n",
      "were both governors, we spent a lot of time working on our public \n",
      "schools and we tried to be very candid with our people in saying that \n",
      "a lot of these things were going to take some time to materialize.  \n",
      "\t     I had a hand in writing the National Education Goals \n",
      "that the governors drafted, along with representatives of President \n",
      "Bush's administration back in 1989.  And what we're going to try to \n",
      "do this year with your leadership is to introduce legislation in \n",
      "Congress that will actually define the things that the national \n",
      "government ought to do to try to help the local schools and the \n",
      "children of this country and the adult learners, too, meet those \n",
      "goals -- making sure that when -- by 2000, people show up for school \n",
      "ready to learn; that we get a 90 percent on-time high school \n",
      "graduation rate; that children at the 4th, 8th, and 12th grades are \n",
      "confident in the subjects they're supposed to know; that they are \n",
      "second to none in math and science; that are schools are safe, \n",
      "disciplined, and drug-free.  And, of course, the fifth goal --I took \n",
      "them out of line to say this the last -- is that we have a system of \n",
      "life-long learning in this country.\n",
      "\t     And each one of those goals there's a national role, a \n",
      "state role, a school role, school district role, and a private sector \n",
      "role.  And what you've attempted to do in this bill you're going to \n",
      "introduce with me in the next few weeks is to define what our job is; \n",
      "and then to give the rest of America a way of defining what their job \n",
      "is and seeing whether we're actually meeting the standards of quality \n",
      "that we need to meet.\n",
      "\t     It's very exciting.  So far as I know, nothing quite \n",
      "like it has ever been done in the form of federal legislation before.  \n",
      "Not mandating and telling people what they have to do with their \n",
      "money, but actually setting up a framework for excellence and \n",
      "partnerships so that we can do our job.  I'm really excited about it.\n",
      "\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, I am, too.  And I think really \n",
      "it will be an entirely new role for the federal government in terms \n",
      "of its relationship with states, serving as a partner really to \n",
      "support and facilitate and to help out in these education reform \n",
      "efforts, all driven by high standards.  That's the point.\n",
      "\t     Bob, let me ask you one question, and then we'll get to \n",
      "the telephone calls.  It's about the same subject.  We have, of \n",
      "course, skills standards that are going to be part of Goals 2000, and \n",
      "I wonder if you would comment on that.\n",
      "\t     SECRETARY REICH:  Well, you know, we have 75 percent of \n",
      "our young people who don't graduate from college.  Very often they \n",
      "don't have very many alternatives.  They do have a wonderful system \n",
      "of community colleges and technical institutions, but if we had \n",
      "national skill standards to which they could aspire and which \n",
      "employers would understand as a national credential, many of these \n",
      "young people would actually find that they were much more eligible \n",
      "for jobs.\n",
      "\t     Everybody doesn't have to go to college.  Other \n",
      "countries you have smaller proportions of their population going to \n",
      "college, but you have a whole level of people who have certain \n",
      "technical, preprofessional skills.  We can do it in this country.  If \n",
      "you don't go to four-year college you're not a loser.  And we want to \n",
      "develop those national skill standards.  We're going to be working \n",
      "with the states, with the Education Department, with a lot of private \n",
      "industry in developing those standards.  And I think they will be the \n",
      "kinds of things that enable our vocational and technical and other \n",
      "institutions to rally around, as well as our business community.\n",
      "\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Well, that's great.  Why don't we go \n",
      "ahead and go to the telephone.  We have a call, I see -- Mayor Bruce \n",
      "Todd of Austin, Texas.\n",
      "\t     Q\t  Yes, Mr. President and Mr. Secretary Reich and \n",
      "Riley, we certainly appreciate the opportunity to join you today.  We \n",
      "have some dedicated professionals and volunteers here in Austin who \n",
      "have heard what you have said and are very appreciative.  Let me \n",
      "simply say, amen to some of the comments made already.  We agree with \n",
      "much of the tone that the Clinton administration has taken, and are \n",
      "very supportive.  \n",
      "\t     We have been successful here in Austin of tripling our \n",
      "summer employment program over the last four years.  We expect to \n",
      "have over 2,000 employed this year in the summertime; perhaps as much \n",
      "as 3,500 with the federal assistance.  \n",
      "\t     Much of the question that we had designed you have \n",
      "answered in your opening comments, so we must be thinking alike.  But \n",
      "the question essentially involved what initiatives after Labor Day \n",
      "would be appropriate.  We know summertime is important.  Year-round \n",
      "is even more important.  And what kind of initiatives at the federal \n",
      "level might be proposed to meet the needs of the youth on a year-\n",
      "round basis?  And perhaps more importantly, how can families and the \n",
      "local community be more involved using the federal initiative? That's \n",
      "something that we believe is very important to success in this \n",
      "effort.\n",
      "\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Mr. President.\n",
      "\t     THE PRESIDENT:  I think I'll give everybody a chance to \n",
      "answer the question, Bruce, but let me first thank you for calling, \n",
      "and thank you for all the great work that you're doing in Austin.  \n",
      "I've seen some of it and I've always been very impressed.  \n",
      "\t     First, with regard to the summer program, we hope we can \n",
      "structure it in a way that will enable us to continue the summer \n",
      "program and that will move a lot of these young people back into \n",
      "schools under circumstances that might allow them to do some work in \n",
      "the private sector, too.  We hope that -- Secretary Reich is going to \n",
      "try to set up a system where we create a lot of private sector jobs \n",
      "to be matched with the public sector jobs this summer.  And we're \n",
      "working on that.\n",
      "\t     Secondly, in the program that I have presented to the \n",
      "Congress over the next five years, what we are attempting to do is to \n",
      "build in an amount of investment that's quite substantial for job \n",
      "training programs, for school-to-work programs, all of which give \n",
      "heavy, heavy weight to local community input -- just the question you \n",
      "asked -- but do provide some federal investment dollars, which we \n",
      "hope you can put with local dollars to keep people working and being \n",
      "trained on a year-round basis.\n",
      "\t     And I will say again, to echo what Secretary Reich said \n",
      "a moment ago, to try to break down the barrier between what is seen \n",
      "as work and what is seen as learning.  An awful lot of young people \n",
      "actually have quite high IQs, but actually learn so much better when \n",
      "they're doing than when they're reading or just listening.  So we \n",
      "hope that the community involvement part of it will be permanent, and \n",
      "we hope that if the whole budget passes -- and we do have 200 budget \n",
      "cuts and more than 200, actually, in the budget -- and some revenue \n",
      "raisers, and some new money for education and training, that we'll be \n",
      "able to do just what you seem to want based on your question.\n",
      "\t     Bob, do you want to say anything?\n",
      "\t     SECRETARY REICH:  Well, you took most of the words out \n",
      "of my mouth, Mr. President, as usual.  But let me just add one thing, \n",
      "and that is that one of the most important aspects of post-high \n",
      "school for a lot of young people who are not going on to college, in \n",
      "addition to the school-to-work program, simply is the availability of \n",
      "jobs.  And we've got to get this economy moving again, obviously.  \n",
      "It's terribly important to get this recovery program, to get the \n",
      "economy back on track.  That's sort of the prerequisite to everything \n",
      "else.  If we don't get the economy back on track -- we have -- I \n",
      "think this is the 16th -- correct me if I'm wrong, Mr. President -- I \n",
      "think is the 16th month we have had seven percent unemployment or \n",
      "greater.  This is a jobless recovery.  A lot of those kids are going \n",
      "to be getting out of school in June.  And even if we did everything \n",
      "right, they would have a very, very hard time getting jobs.\n",
      "\t     SECRETARY RILEY:  Thank you both.  Of course, Goals 2000 \n",
      "will be a permanent, long-term thing that will certainly reach into \n",
      "next year.  It will involve, if passed -- and we certainly hope it \n",
      "will be -- action plans with every state where we can be working \n",
      "together to reach for the goals in a number of different ways.  And \n",
      "then the state, with all the various school districts, a very \n",
      "important part of that will be citizen and parent involvement.  And I \n",
      "think everybody will see a great energy out there, once we get that \n",
      "moving.\n",
      "\t     The next call is Dr. Harry Heinemann, New York.  \n",
      "\t     Doctor?\n",
      "\t     Q\t  Good evening, Mr. Secretary.  It is a pleasure to \n",
      "be on with you this evening.  As you may know, bridging the school \n",
      "and work has been central to La Guardia's educational program since \n",
      "its inception in the 1970s, and that includes the college, the two \n",
      "alternative high schools that operate on our campus, and the linkages \n",
      "we have forged with the local schools.  We have found this to be an \n",
      "extremely effective learning strategy.\n",
      "\t     And over the years, we've come to believe that there are \n",
      "several principles that are very important in bridging the school and \n",

      "on.\n",
      "\t     Q\t  What is our position about the Japanese?  That they \n",
      "may have to say one thing, but actualy mean another?\n",
      "\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No.  The position on the Japanese \n",
      "is as the President stated to President Yeltsin throughout the two \n",
      "days.  He said that he had had a good conversation with Prime \n",
      "Minister Miazawa prior to the Summit.  He reiterated the U.S. \n",
      "position, the long-standing support for the Japanese position on the \n",
      "Kuril Islands, but also reiterated Prime Minister Miazawa's \n",
      "commitment to move forward on the G-7 process and to play a \n",
      "constructive role.  And I think President Yeltsin was very glad to \n",
      "hear that.\n",
      "\t     Q\t  After listening to Secretary Christopher on Iraq \n",
      "for the last few days, I'm a little confused.  What is the U.S. \n",
      "policy?  Do you want to see Saddam Hussein overturned?\n",
      "\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's the same policy that Secretary \n",
      "Christopher has reiterated, and all of the U.S officials have \n",
      "reiterated.  We expect full and complete and unequivocal compliance \n",
      "with all U.N. resolutions.  Right now we do not have that compliance.\n",
      "\t     Q\t     throwing it out further that if Iraq complies, \n",
      "Saddam can't stay in office?\n",
      "\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Right.  I think that that's -- our \n",
      "judgment is that it is not possible for Saddam Hussein to comply with \n",
      "the resolutions and stay in power.  But the important point is that \n",
      "we expect compliance by Iraq with all U.N. resolutions, and we will \n",
      "continue to demand it.\n",
      "\t     Q\t  And are you concerned the Iran will become the \n",
      "dominant power in the area --\n",
      "\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Secretary Christopher has also \n",
      "spoken to Iran over the last several days, and he says we also expect \n",
      "full Iranian compliance with all international norms, and stopping \n",
      "support of terrorism.\n",
      "\t     Q\t  That's a very glib statement that he won't stay in \n",
      "power if he complies with U.N. resolutions.  On what logic do you \n",
      "base that?\n",
      "\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Right now Saddam Hussein is not \n",
      "complying with the U.N. resolutions at all.  He is not respecting the \n",
      "rights of his people, as is required by the U.N. resolution.  He is \n",

      "He is not fully complying with all the resolutions regarding \n",
      "armaments.\n",

      "would be out of power?\n",
      "\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, right now his power rests on \n",
      "the repression of his people.  If he stopped doing that it would make \n",
      "it more difficult for him to stay in power.\n",
      "\t     Q\t  George, back on the stimulus package, why is it \n",
      "that you and the President accuse the Republicans of playing pure \n",
      "politics and perpetuating gridlock?  Why is it that -- what evidence \n",
      "do you have that they just don't have a genuine idealogical \n",
      "difference with you that's in good faith?\n",
      "\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the fact that several times \n",
      "in the past the Republicans, many of the ones who are now leading the \n",
      "fight for the filibuster, have supported the very funding they now \n",
      "seek to stop, most especially, the highway funding.  \n",
      "\t     Q\t  George, in regards to that, some of the moderate \n",

      "them during the -- while the plan was put together, that they had \n",
      "one, sort of, proforma meeting between the White House and the Senate \n",
      "Republicans, and that was it.  Does the Administration look back and \n",
      "thinks perhaps it could have done a better job of working with some -\n",
      "\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I'm not sure that it's true \n",
      "that there was only one meeting.  I mean, the President met with the \n",
      "Republican leadership on at least two occasions before the \n",
      "introduction of his package.  He met with the entire Senate \n",
      "Republican Caucus also for lunch, and went up there.  We are \n",
      "continually in contact with as many Republicans as we can find who \n",
      "have an interest in the President's package.  We are interested in \n",
      "what they have to say, as well.  But we believe that this program is \n",
      "important, and we're going to continue to fight for it.\n",
      "\t     Q\t     your all or nothing, do it with the Democrats \n",
      "alone strategy, did you maybe miscalculate the ability to get it \n",
      "through?\n",
      "\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I mean, I think that there is \n",
      "no question that under the Senate rules a determined minority can \n",
      "frustrate activity.  I mean, there is just no question about that.  \n",
      "You only need 40 plus one to keep going.  40 plus one to keep going \n",
      "and to stop any action, and that's what the Republicans are doing.\n",

      "look for the support of Republicans whenever we can get it on the \n",
      "President's intiatives?\n",
      "\t     Q\t  But on this one -- how are you going to do it \n",
      "differently than you did it on this one because on this one you \n",
      "really did stiff the Republicans from the beginning and made it clear \n",
      "that it was a Democratic majority that would get this through and \n",
      "could get it through and you really didn't need Republican votes?  \n",
      "Are you going to take a different tack when you have to go for \n",

      "\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I can't see into the future and \n",
      "understand every possible turn in the legislative road.  Clearly the \n",
      "President's going to continue to reach out when he can.\n",
      "\t     Q\t  You don't have any regrets then about the way you \n",
      "have handled it up to now and you don't plan any changes in your \n",
      "approach in dealing with the Republicans in Congress based on this \n",
      "experience?\n",
      "\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Obviously the President would like \n",
      "his package passed as quickly as possible and he's going to continue \n",
      "to press for that.  We will continue to reach out to Republicans, \n",
      "there's not question about that.  And we'll continue to reason with \n",
      "them and try and find appropriate avenues for cooperation.  In this \n",

      "Iraqi compliance.  I don't know if we can get into the business of \n",

      "\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Good morning.  The \n",
      "President -- President Clinton and President Yeltsin agreed \n",
      "yesterday on a series of American initiatives to support economic \n",
      "and political reform in Russia, and it's valued at $1.6 billion.  \n",
      "\t     Before taking your questions and running through the \n",
      "basic outlines of this package, I want to make a few points.  \n",
      "First, this is the maximum that the Clinton administration can do \n",
      "with available funds to support Russian reform.  All of the funds \n",
      "have been allocated and appropriated by the Congress.  There is \n",
      "no need for the administration to go back to the Congress to fund \n",
      "any of these programs.  All our Fiscal Year '93 funds currently \n",
      "are available, so in effect, all of these programs can begin \n",
      "tomorrow.\n",
      "\t     The second point is that this package is designed to \n",
      "support Russian reformers.  All of the initiatives in the package \n",
      "are directed at reformers and for their benefit, and all have \n",
      "been worked out with prior consultation with the Russian \n",
      "government.\n",
      "\t     Third, the President is determined that we will \n",
      "deliver on these commitments this year.  The package is designed \n",
      "to maximize our ability to support reform.  In designing it we \n",
      "wanted to avoid making commitments that we could not meet, and we \n",
      "feel very confident that we can meet all of these commitments in \n",
      "front of you.\n",
      "\t     Fourth, I'd like to note the special importance of \n",
      "trade and investment.  I think it's fair to say that Russia's \n",
      "capital and technology needs throughout the next decade extend \n",
      "well into the hundreds of billions of dollars.  No collection of \n",
      "governments can meet those needs; only the private sector can do \n",
      "so.  And so the President and President Yeltsin agreed to make \n",
      "trade and investment a major priority in the relationship.  \n",
      "\t     They also agreed that there would be a new joint \n",
      "commission on energy and space formed, headed on the U.S. side by \n",
      "Vice President Gore; on the Russian side by Prime Minister \n",
      "Chernomyrdin.  And the goal of this effort is to break through \n",
      "the barriers to trade and investment on both sides and to promote \n",
      "a vastly expanded relationship.\n",
      "\t     If it would be helpful I'd be prepared to run down \n",
      "the first page, which is a summary of U.S. assistance, and just \n",
      "give you some general background on what these programs are.  \n",
      "I'll do it quickly and then I'll be glad to take questions.\n",
      "\t     The first group of initiatives are humanitarian food \n",
      "and medical assistance.  This is part of our effort which has \n",
      "been underway for several years to provide basic humanitarian \n",
      "grant food assistance so that the Russian government can assure \n",
      "there's at least a minimal amount of bread on the shelves in the \n",
      "major cities.  That's $194 million in grant -- that is from Food \n",
      "for Progress, the grant portion of Food for Progress.  We'll also \n",
      "be continuing our grant assistance in medicines and \n",
      "pharmaceutical supplies, and that's $30 million.\n",
      "\t     The second item is concessional food sales.  As you \n",
      "know, the United States has had a long-term grain relationship \n",
      "with Russia.  It's important to us and it's important to Russia \n",
      "that we continue that relationship.  The President has chosen the \n",
      "Food for Progress program which is a concessional loan program.  \n",
      "The value over the next seven months is $700 million.  These are \n",
      "concessional terms.  The exact terms have not been worked out, \n",
      "but I think it's fair to say there will be a grace period on \n",
      "principal of six or seven years, and concessional rates \n",
      "thereafter for the life of the deal.\n",
      "\t     The third program is a collection of private sector \n",
      "support.  We think this is one of the most important things we're \n",
      "going to do.  Privatization and the creation of small businesses \n",
      "is the number one priority of the reform government in Moscow.  \n",
      "And so the President has decided to create a Russian-American \n",
      "enterprise fund capitalized this year at $50 million.  And the \n",
      "goal of this fund is to make direct loans to small businesses in \n",
      "Russia, to take equity positions in those businesses.  \n",
      "\t     The President has also decided to create a \n",
      "privatization fund which would work directly with the Russian \n",
      "government in its priority objective of trying to convert state \n",
      "enterprises from a state-owned basis to a private basis.  He has \n",
      "also agreed -- the President has also agreed to establish a \n",
      "Eurasia foundation.  This would be a private foundation led by \n",
      "prominent Americans to fund democratization projects in Russia.\n",
      "\t     The fourth grouping you see there in the summary \n",
      "page is democratization itself.  I think it's fair to say that \n",
      "this administration has given a new impetus to the goal of \n",
      "pursuing democratization in Russia.  You see that we have a total \n",
      "of $48 million in programs, various programs.  The detailed \n",
      "tables give an indication of some of the programs that we're \n",
      "launching.  \n",
      "\t     The President is also calling for the development of \n",
      "a democracy corps, which will be an overarching umbrella group to \n",
      "try to incorporate all of the disparate private and public \n",
      "efforts now underway from the United States to support reform in \n",
      "Russia.\n",
      "\t     The fifth program you see is Russian office of \n",
      "resettlement.  This is a new initiative created and \n",
      "conceptualized by this administration.  This is a demonstration \n",
      "project.  What we'd like to do is work with the Russian military \n",
      "to help resettle Russian officers returning from the Baltic \n",
      "states and other parts of the former Soviet Union.  We want to \n",
      "make sure that we work out the best way to do that, whether it's \n",
      "with Russian labor and Russian materials or using prefab American \n",
      "construction.  And so we've decided to fund on a demonstration \n",
      "basis the construction of 450 housing units.  We'll be working \n",
      "very closely with the Russian military on this.  And I would say \n",
      "that we have a long-term commitment to this project.  \n",
      "\t     The sixth area is energy in the environment.  They \n",
      "are two issues that the President feels strongly about.  Our \n",
      "initial efforts will be feasibility studies to look into the \n",
      "possibility of enhancing their energy production, both oil and \n",
      "gas; and equally important trying to cut down on the leakages in \n",
      "the oil and gas pipeline systems, which cause so much \n",
      "environmental damage.\n",
      "\t     I've talked a little bit about trade and investment, \n",
      "about the new group being created that the Vice President will \n",
      "chair on our side.  Secretary Ron Brown will also be cochairing \n",
      "with Deputy Prime Minister Shohkin, a business development \n",
      "committee, which will work in all other sectors of the economy, \n",
      "to break down the many barriers that currently exist and impede \n",
      "trade and investment.  We are also going to appoint a full-time \n",
      "investment ombudsman in the American government to work on this \n",
      "problem full-time.  \n",
      "\t     And the point I'd like to make here is, trade and \n",
      "investment in the 1990s is every bit as important, to draw an \n",
      "analogy, as arms reductions was in the '70s and '80s.  And we \n",
      "just thought that in looking at this we needed to make a \n",
      "commitment within our own government to have people work on it -- \n",
      "senior people on a full-time basis, because it is terribly \n",
      "important.\n",
      "\t     You'll notice that the United States is going to \n",
      "support Russia's membership in the GATT.  Russia has had observer \n",
      "status.  Russia has requested our support and, in fact, requested \n",
      "our advice in becoming a member of the GATT.  We think that the \n",
      "long-term goal of drawing Russia into the global economy is \n",
      "paramount, a very important goal.  And that is why we are \n",
      "supporting the membership in the GATT.  We are also supporting \n",
      "their access to GSP, the Generalized System of Preferences.  \n",

      "credit for a caterpillar deal in Siberia, that OPIC has extended \n",
      "$150 million in credits and loan guarantees for a Conoco oil \n",
      "project.  I'd like to emphasize that we are very close to an \n",
      "agreement between Russia and the United States for a $2-billion \n",
      "framework facility through the Ex-Im Bank that would finance \n",
      "Russian purchases of American oil and gas equipment and services. \n",
      "We think this is a very important development.  We think we'll \n",
      "get there by April 14th, which is the opening day of the Tokyo \n",
      "conference, the G-7 conference.\n",
      "\t     Before I take any further questions, I'd like to \n",
      "defer to my colleague, who will review the security assistance \n",
      "objectives with you.\n",
      "\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Our major \n",
      "unfinished agenda with the Russians and with their counterparts \n",
      "in Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Belarus is in the area of the safe and \n",
      "secure dismantlement of the nuclear arsenals on their territory \n",
      "under the terms of the START I and START II agreements.   \n",
      "Recently we completed in Moscow three, I think, very important \n",
      "agreements that devote a significant chunk of Nunn-Lugar funding \n",
      "to three important programs.  The first is the program of $130 \n",
      "million for the strategic nuclear delivery vehicle dismantlement \n",
      "program.  That is for submarines, for ICBM dismantlement and for \n",
      "bomber dismantlement -- $130 million.\n",
      "\t     The second is a $75 million tranche of funding for \n",
      "the construction of a facility to store nuclear materials removed \n",
      "from the warheads as they are dismantled.  This will essentially \n",
      "contribute to the overall design and the early phases of the \n",
      "construction of that storage facility.  \n",

      "add that $215-million total to the extant Nunn-Lugar assistance \n",

      "\t     So this is an area where we will be going a lot more \n",
      "work with not only the Russians but with the Ukrainians, Kazhaks, \n",
      "and Belarussians.  Belarus, for example, has just, in the last \n",
      "couple of weeks, received up to $65 million in FY'93 funds for \n",
      "safety, security and dismantlement programs on Belarussian \n",
      "territory.  And this was in the wake of their ratification of \n",
      "START I, an agreement to accede to NPT. \n",
      "\t     So we are working very hard with all the parties to \n",
      "the Lisbon protocols, and will continue to work very hard with \n",
      "them.  And I look upon these three recent agreements with Russia \n",
      "as a very important step in that process.\n",

      "Kazhakstan.  Why do you feel now it is necessary -- if it's the \n",
      "same one, why do you feel it's necessary?\n",
      "\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  It's not the same \n",
      "deal.  Chevron signed a deal with Kazhakstan, the Tenges oil \n",
      "field.  This is a new investment project.  It's a polar lights \n",
      "oil development and renovation project, and it's being announced \n",
      "today.  So it's completely new.\n",
      "\t     Q\t  Can you tell us more about what's involved?\n",
      "\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Yes.  Conoco, like \n",
      "other American oil companies has been searching for ways to do \n",
      "two things.  One, to prospect for new oil in Siberia, west \n",
      "Siberia; and two, to try to get into the business of renovating \n",
      "oil wells and renovating pipelines, both oil and gas, in Russia.  \n",
      "The objective here, obviously, is to take advantage of the \n",
      "natural resources in Russia, increase energy production, which \n",
      "will, in turn, increase hard currency revenues, which is what \n",
      "Russia needs.\n",
      "\t     So we think this deal is very, very good development \n",
      "for Russia.  The Russians do as well, and it's good for an \n",
      "American company.  And the American government has played a \n",
      "leading role in pulling this together through the credit facility \n",
      "in OPIC and through the loan guarantee.\n",
      "\t     Q\t  So it's to search and also to renovate fields \n",
      "that are already there?\n",
      "\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  That's right.\n",
      "\t     Q\t  On that point, should other American companies \n",
      "expect to get administration support for such deals, or should \n",
      "they now go to the Ex-Im and try to get the money out of the $2 \n",
      "billion?\n",
      "\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, as you know, \n",
      "Ex-Im is part of the U.S. government and various parts of the \n",
      "U.S. government have been pushing, including the State Department \n",
      "and the White House for this deal to be consummated.  And we \n",
      "think it will.  And if we arrive at this agreement by April 14th, \n",
      "there will be $2 billion in financing available for American \n",
      "companies to sell their equipment and sell their services.\n",
      "\t     Q\t  That should take up all of the rest of the \n",
      "deals and their won't be -- and their will or there won't be \n",
      "support for OPIC sort of deals such as this Conoco?\n",
      "\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  There's a \n",
      "tremendous amount of interest on the part of American oil and gas \n",
      "companies to invest in Russia.  We think that the Ex-Im oil and \n",
      "gas facility, the $2-billion facility, once it is concluded, will \n",
      "soak up a lot of that interest.  But I think the interest may \n",

      "\t     Q\t  What's the current year budget costs of that \n",
      "$2-billion agreement should it go forward?  And is there any \n",
      "current year budget costs --\n",
      "\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I'll have to refer \n",
      "you to Ex-Im for that.  I don't know the details of that.\n",
      "\t     Q\t  The concessional food sales -- is there any \n",
      "current year costs to that, or is it delayed until the years in \n",
      "which the payments are due?\n",
      "\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  The concessional \n",
      "food sales are from Food for Progress, which is a USDA program.  \n",
      "USDA has the funds, we don't need to go back to the Congress to \n",
      "expend those funds.  There will be a hit in the budget.  I'd \n",
      "refer you to USDA and OMB for the details on that.\n",
      "\t     Q\t  Can you talk about the Democracy Corps?\n",
      "\t     Q\t     and the private sector -- how many folks are \n",
      "going to be involved in that?\n",
      "\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Why don't I start \n",
      "with the Democracy Corps first.  I think the administration felt \n",
      "coming into office that there were literally thousands of \n",
      "organization, private organizations in the United States that in \n",
      "one way or another were working at the goal of trying to achieve \n",
      "democratization in Russia, helping on a farmer-to-farmer basis.  \n",
      "And there were literally 10 or 15 U.S. government agencies that \n",
      "had a variety of programs in this area.  And so the \n",
      "administration felt -- the President felt it was important to try \n",
      "to draw all of these initiatives together under one group to give \n",
      "some coherence to the efforts and to give some impetus to the \n",
      "efforts.  And so this is a presidential initiative.\n",
      "\t     It will be headed by Ambassador Tom Simons who will \n",
      "soon take up his duties as the coordinator for U.S. assistance in \n",
      "the former Soviet Union.  And we're very hopeful that we might \n",
      "use this Democracy Corps not only to draw upon the resources of \n",
      "our own government, but the resources of the American private \n",
      "sector and schools and communities across the nation.\n",
      "\t     Q\t     any kind of commitment yet, any kind of word \n",
      "yet on FY'94, and any new money that needs to be appropriated \n",
      "besides the $300 million the President talked about?\n",
      "\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  The administration \n",
      "is requesting additional funds in FY'94 of $700 million.  What \n",
      "the President has done this weekend is to consult really \n",
      "intensively yesterday with President Yeltsin about additional \n",
      "measures the United States could take in some of these areas to \n",
      "support reform.  He'll be consulting with the Congress.  When he \n",
      "returns to Washington, he'll be consulting also with the other \n",
      "ally governments, and we'll make a decision at that time.\n",
      "\t     Q\t  Two questions about the $700 billion \n",
      "agricultural money.  First of all, I thought it was the sort of \n",
      "consensus that what Russia did not need was more loans for food.  \n",
      "So why did you decide to do it that way?  Secondly, could you \n",
      "explain -- agriculture has been stopped from making further loans \n",
      "for food because of Russia's inability to pay.  How does this fit \n",
      "into that situation?\n",
      "\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  As you know, the \n",
      "United States for a long time has been a major supplier of grains \n",
      "and food commodities, agricultural products to Russia.  I think \n",
      "between 1991 and '92 we had extended -- a little bit of history \n",
      "here -- about $5.5 billion in credits, credit guarantees, through \n",
      "the Commodity Credit Corporation.  That was the principal vehicle \n",
      "to ensure the sale of American grain products.  On December 1 of \n",
      "last year, '92, the Russian government stopped its payments on \n",
      "that program.  They are now in arrears to us on that program, and \n",
      "therefore, by law, the United States cannot continue that \n",
      "program.  And so the President, working with Secretary Espy and \n",
      "other officials in the Cabinet, looked for other ways that we \n",
      "could promote American grain sales.  \n",
      "\t     And I think we have two ways to do that.  We've \n",
      "announced today $194 million in grant food assistance through the \n",
      "Food for Progress program.  But we do not have sufficient \n",
      "authority to spend $700 million in grant food, and so we looked \n",
      "for a concessional loan program.  \n",
      "\t     I think everybody agrees that Russia -- that a \n",
      "short-term loan program for Russia would not make sense now, but \n",
      "a long-term concessional loan program would.  And that is what \n",
      "this program is.  It will provide, once the final details are \n",
      "worked out, for a six to seven-year grace period on payments of \n",
      "principal.  And then from years seven through 15, which is the \n",
      "life of the deal, it will provide for concessional rates of \n",
      "interest -- generally around three to four percent.  And so we \n",
      "believe and the Russian government believes this is a good deal \n",
      "for them because it will avoid the imperative of early payments \n",
      "and put them into the out years, but it will also continue this \n",
      "very important grain relationship, which is important for them, \n",
      "and it's important for the American farm community.\n",
      "\t     Q\t  I gather from what you say that this could make \n",
      "it explicit -- the Russians' failure to pay the interest on ECC \n",
      "loan does not in any way affect this kind of loan going through, \n",
      "is that right? \n",
      "\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Let me be explicit \n",
      "about that.  We are prevented under the law to from continuing  \n",
      "the Commodity Credit Corporation short-term credit program \n",
      "because of Russia's arrearages to the United States.  All of you \n",
      "know about those arrearages.  They total about, I think, around \n",
      "$640 million.  USDA can give you an exact figure.  So having \n",
      "taken that into consideration and wanting to preserve American \n",
      "market share and a long-term grain relationship, wanting to \n",
      "respond to a specific request from the Russian government for \n",
      "major food assistance, knowing that we couldn't take it from the \n",
      "grant programs because we don't have sufficient authority there, \n",
      "we looked at Food for Progress, which is a program we've used to \n",
      "great effect in other parts of the world.  And we consulted with \n",
      "the Russian government and arrived at this solution.  \n",
      "\t     I think the Russians are pleased because it provides \n",
      "them with the food, but also gives them a little bit of relief on \n",
      "the short-term payments.\n",
      "\t     Q\t  Where do those funds actually come from?\n",
      "\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  They come from the \n",
      "Food for Progress program, which is a program under USDA's \n",
      "authority.  USDA has the authority to spend these funds.  We do \n",
      "not need to go back to the Congress for these funds.  And I want \n",
      "to make that general point again:  Everything in this package, \n",
      "the $1.6 billion package, comprises funds that have already been \n",
      "allocated and appropriated by the Congress.  The administration \n",
      "can begin to spend these monies tomorrow.  And it's very \n",
      "important in our eyes that we expend all the funds this year, \n",
      "that we meet these commitments.  And we are confident we'll be \n",
      "able to do so.\n",
      "\t     Q\t  How did you arrive at the figure of $700 \n",
      "million -- does that max out that program, or did you actually \n",
      "have a range from 0 to --\n",
      "\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  There's a reason \n",
      "for it.  The reason was that the Russian government told us \n",
      "that's about the amount of grain that they needed between now and \n",
      "harvest time.  And so the idea is that we would begin the \n",
      "shipments probably $100 million per month from now until the \n",
      "harvest in the autumn, at which time Russia won't require the \n",
      "same level of food imports from the West.\n",
      "\t     Q\t  I would imagine there's going to be some \n",
      "considerable envy and jealousy on the part of some of the other \n",
      "republics because of the size and the scope of this with Russia.  \n",
      "Have you given any consideration to advancing negotiations for \n",
      "the same kinds of projects with the Ukraine, with Georgia , with \n",
      "some of the other republics?\n",
      "\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: Yes, we're very \n",
      "conscience of the fact that we also have an interest in extending \n",
      "American support to the 11 other countries of the former Soviet \n",
      "Union.  We have told ourselves, and we have planned that in the \n",
      "area of technical assistance, the grant technical assistance that \n",
      "you see, roughly 50 percent of the funding will go to Russia and \n",
      "roughly 50 percent to the other countries. \n",
      "\t     In the area of food sales, we have been active with \n",
      "Ukraine, in grant food assistance with Georgia and Armenia.  We \n",
      "will continue that.  And I think it's fair to say that after this \n",
      "summit we will go back and look at all of our programs with the \n",
      "other countries to ensure that they are adequate and they are \n",
      "productive and they're hard-hitting.\n",
      "\t     Q\t  Has anything happened at the summit to lead \n",
      "American energy companies and other companies to believe that \n",
      "Russia is going to be more user-friendly toward them in terms of \n",
      "taxing, legalities, bureaucracy?\n",
      "\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, one of our \n",
      "primary objectives coming into this summit was to highlight,  not \n",
      "only the economic agenda, but also trade and investment.  And I'd \n",
      "like to refer to the point I made at the beginning.  We're \n",
      "convinced in talking about this problem -- the problem of how to \n",
      "support Russia long-term -- we're convinced that no collection of \n",
      "Western governments have the financial resources over the next \n",
      "decade to fuel the continuation of reform, that only the private \n",
      "sector can do that.  \n",
      "\t     We look at our own society and we see tremendous \n",
      "capability in resources in the oil and gas sector.  It is a very \n",
      "good match with what the Russians need now, which is financial \n",
      "investment in the existing oil and gas wells and pipeline and new \n",
      "technology and new capital to finance new production.  \n",
      "\t     That's what the Russian government has told us it \n",
      "wants to do, and so that's why we have made such a major emphasis \n",
      "on it.  That's why trade and investment was a prominent issue on \n",
      "the first day of these talks, and in fact, figured prominently \n",
      "last night in the meeting between President Yeltsin and President \n",
      "Clinton.  And we're hoping that together we might send a strong \n",
      "signal to the American business community that we support their \n",
      "efforts to invest in Russia, that the United States, through Ex-\n",
      "Im and OPEC and the Department of Commerce, will be there to \n",
      "support them.\n",
      "\t     Q\t  My question is, is Yeltsin in any position to \n",
      "deliver on making Russia a more --\n",
      "\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  We think he is.  I \n",
      "would note that President Yeltsin's Prime Minister, Mr. \n",
      "Chernomyrdin, worked for 30 years in the Russian oil and gas \n",
      "sector.  He will now chair a high-level commission with the Vice \n",
      "President, Vice President Gore, to try to break through the \n",
      "barriers that currently exist to Western investment in the oil \n",
      "and gas sector.  We believe we have a commitment to make that \n",
      "committee an important committee.  And we're looking forward to \n",
      "the work.\n",
      "\t     Q\t  What type of mechanism is already in place to \n",
      "administer the private sector portion of the program?  And will \n",
      "the U.S. be directly involved in the tail end of distribution of \n",
      "the actual funds or is the money simply turned over to the \n",
      "Russian government for distribution at their will?\n",
      "\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Are you talking \n",
      "about the variety of programs listed here?  It depends on the \n",
      "program itself.  In most cases, though, we are either working \n",
      "through American PBOs or American government agencies to ensure \n",
      "that the money obviously is well spent, that the money gets to \n",
      "the intended source.  That's an obligation we have to the \n",
      "Congress to ensure the money is well spent and that we can \n",
      "account for the money.  We have done that in the last couple of \n",
      "months intensively and we will continue to do it for each of \n",
      "these programs.\n",
      "\t     But they are all quite different.  For instance, in \n",
      "the area of grant food and medical assistance, for grant food it \n",
      "is carried out through USDA and USDA accounts for the delivery of \n",
      "the food.  For grant medical assistance, we've been working \n",
      "through Project Hope which is a private organization.  For the \n",
      "housing -- for instance, the resettlement of Russian officers, \n",
      "we'll be working with a group of American PBOs.  On some of the \n",
      "democratization projects, we're working directly with Russian \n",
      "private individuals and private foundations.  We're working with \n",
      "journalists in Russia on a media project that you may have \n",
      "noticed.\n",
      "\t     So we literally have here 30 to 40 different \n",
      "activities under all these rubrics and they're all going to be \n",
      "carried out in slightly different ways.  Some directly with the \n",
      "Russian government, some with Russian citizens.\n",
      "\t     Q\t  The Jackson-Vanik restrictions that remain and \n",
      "on the COCOM restrictions that remain, can you tell us what the \n",
      "President has to do on that?\n",
      "\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, as George \n",
      "noted yesterday, President Yeltsin raised these as irritants in \n",
      "the relationship.  The President has noted that.  I think it's \n",
      "fair to say we will go back now in our own government when we \n",
      "return to Washington and look at both of these questions, and \n",
      "we'll get back to the Russian government.\n",
      "\t     Q\t  You were not prepared for these questions when \n",
      "you got here?\n",
      "\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  We were prepared \n",
      "for these questions.  We've looked at them.  But we're not \n",
      "prepared to make a quick decision this weekend.  They require --\n",
      "let me just explain, particularly on Jackson-Vanik.  They require \n",
      "consultation with the Congress.  They require consultation with \n",
      "the American Jewish community.  And we're very sensitive to those \n",
      "concerns.  And so we'll want to go back and talk to them before \n",
      "we take any action.\n",
      "\t     Q\t  Is this package designed so that you will not \n",
      "have to go to Congress for anything at this point?\n",
      "\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  As I said at the \n",
      "beginning, the advantage of this particular package is that all \n",
      "the funds have been allocated and appropriated by the Congress.  \n",
      "So the administration will not have to go back to the Congress to \n",
      "seek any additional authority to fund any of these efforts.  In \n",
      "effect, they can all begin tomorrow, and I know that many of the \n",
      "agencies responsible for these projects will begin tomorrow.  And \n",
      "that's the advantage of this particular initiative.\n",
      "\t     Q\t  If this, as the President says, is a long-term, \n",
      "long-haul thing, and members of Congress are at this moment \n",
      "heading for Moscow, why aren't you talking about going to \n",
      "Congress and suggesting to the President of Russia that you are \n",
      "prepared to go to Congress for various things?\n",
      "\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think we've been \n",
      "clear about that.  The President is discussing this weekend with \n",
      "President Yeltsin some additional ideas that we have for American \n",
      "funding of additional projects, and ideas that he has.  We have a \n",
      "major congressional delegation that left last night, headed by \n",
      "Representative Gephardt and we'll want to consult with that \n",
      "delegation and other members of Congress before doing anything.  \n",
      "And we'll also want to consult with our allies.  So that's where \n",
      "it stands now.\n",
      "\t     Q\t  We've been told repeatedly that a number of \n",
      "these items represent different or new ways of spending the money \n",
      "already appropriated.  Could you just tick off which of these \n",
      "items represents reprogramming or at least spending money in ways \n",
      "that it was not previously set to be?\n",
      "\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think that we've \n",
      "said that these are all projects that either Congress had \n",
      "allocated money for through the Freedom Support Act; there were \n",
      "some funds that were left over from FY'92.  And this \n",
      "administration took office and had some new ideas about how the \n",
      "funds might be expended.\n",
      "\t     We didn't use just the Freedom Support Act funds or \n",
      "the FY'92 funds.  We went into some of the agency allocations --\n",
      "Ex-Im, OPIC, and USDA -- and tried to look for creative ways to \n",
      "further our programs.\n",
      "\t     And example of that is the Food for Progress \n",
      "concessional loans.  We had hit a brick wall with another type of \n",
      "funding through USDA.  We could not go forward legally, and so we \n",
      "looked for a more creative way to ensure continued American \n",
      "market share and ensure continued grain sales, and we think we \n",
      "found it.\n",
      "\t     Q\t  Where, for example, are you getting the money \n",

      "impetus to all of us in the agencies to think much more broadly \n",
      "about what it is we can do on democratization, because there we \n",
      "have some experience and some comparative advantage that lends \n",

      "\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, the President \n",
      "is today calling for the creation of a democracy corps.  I think \n",
      "it's fair to say that we're going to work out its framework over \n",
      "the next couple of weeks.  Ambassador Simons takes up his duties \n",
      "on May 1st.  But in effect we've already started, because over \n",

      "out to people in the private sector who have come to us asking us \n",
      "to help facilitate their activities in Russia.  And we've said \n",
      "that we will be helpful.  We've also tried to kind of coordinate \n",
      "in a much more effective way the activities of our own \n",

      "\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  No, I think --\n",
      "unfortunately the press has been a little bit off the mark, and \n",
      "I'm sorry to say that.  No, this package -- President Clinton put \n",
      "us to work about seven weeks ago on this package.  And he was \n",
      "briefed intensively on this.  He contributed a lot of the \n",
      "intellectual leadership in this package.  He contributed a lot of \n",
      "the ideas in the package.  And I think it's fair to say that we \n",
      "had this rough package worked out about two weeks ago.  We have \n",
      "been refining it ever since.  We spent a couple of days last week \n",
      "going over it with the Russian government, both the embassy in \n",

      "Is that in the out years?\n",

      "important; and that first and foremost the effort to privatize \n",
      "the state industries is important to them.  \n",

      "ago.  We have since then consulted with the Russian government on \n",
      "the final stages of its development, and so this weekend we've \n",
      "primarily talked about future, about what more the United States \n",
      "and other Western countries can do to support reform in Russia, \n",
      "which is our base objective here.\n",
      "\t     Q\t  I noticed that you -- that money appropriated \n",

      "privatization?\n",
      "\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  You're right; we \n",
      "have a program to train Russian -- young Russians in banking and \n",

      "housing the right way, it's not just the building the framework \n",
      "of a house, you've got to think about all the utilities.  You've \n",

      "out of -- Riga or Tallin or Vilnius in a house in western Russia.  \n",
      "We think we have an obligation to try to retrain those officers \n",

      "Germans and the Turks and the Italians have had in building \n",
      "housing in western Russian, we did not want to leap into it with \n",
      "a huge amount of money.  What we want to do is work over the next \n",

      "\t     SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  Well, look, I think \n",
      "it's important to note that the United States on its own does not \n",
      "have the capability to fuel a continuation of Russian reform.  \n",
      "It's got to be a collective Western effort, and we're looking to \n",
      "our allies to do more as well.  But beyond that, it's really what \n",
      "the Russians do that is going to decide the fate of reform.  We \n",

      "go back to the fundamental objective of our policy toward Russia, \n",

      "\t     All these things are part and parcel of a comprehensive \n",
      "plan.  It's also important, as I said, that we create more jobs.  The \n",

      "would also enable us to absorb more young people coming into the work \n",
      "force in jobs that otherwise will not be created.\n",
      "\t      It also will help a lot of cities and counties to \n",

      "economic policy.  We have passed our overall economic plan; it \n",

      "than we've had in the previous 12.  We reduced the deficit and, \n",
      "at the same time, increased investment in jobs and education and \n",
      "health care, in the things that will make us a stronger country.\n",

      "to try to cut the unemployment rate by a half a percent; but also \n",
      "to try to spark job creation in the private sector more.  The \n",
      "plan passed the House.  It has the support of a majority of the \n",
      "Senate.  At the present time, all the Republican   senators as a \n",

      "First, it caused a slowdown in the race toward the South Atlantic\n",
      "by the British armada.  The task force had to be regrouped into a\n",
      "configuration better suited for an enroute defense, but that cost\n",
      "valuable time.  Public announcements from London about the\n",
      "progress of the fleet reflected this slowdown.  The timetable for\n",
      "arrival on battle stations near the Falklands started stretching\n",
      "out longer and longer.  All this bought extra time for the joint\n",

      "involved in the Atlantic, which meant that the Royal Navy could\n",
      "be in big trouble.  During the dead of night, early April 15, the\n",

      "southern New Zealand.  They deployed to a secret operational\n",
      "headquarters area in the Antipodes Islands, 450 miles southeast\n",
      "of New Zealand.  Their electromagnetic shields were operating to\n",
      "provide protection from attack.  These shields make it impossible\n",

      "New Zealand!\n",
      "   The British ship's sinking of April 14 was also followed by\n",
      "other events.  On April 15 the Argentine Navy started moving out\n",
      "of port.  The same day, Alexander Haig arrived again in Buenos\n",
      "Aires.  Supposedly he was there as a diplomat, but in reality he\n",

      "the eye due to their protective shields, which also protect\n",

      "tactics which the Russians employed.\n",
      "   Floating overhead, the Cosmospheres located the seven ships\n",
      "using their Psychoenergetic Range-Finding equipment known as PRF. \n",
      "As I have reported in the past, there is no method known by which\n",
      "PRF can be jammed.  The Cosmospheres radioed the exact locations\n",
      "of the ships to the attack submarines.  The \"subs\" were armed\n",
